      <p><span class="kicker">Course Overview</span>This course will introduce students to various modern tools and techniques used to create interactive map experiences that live on the web.  Students will learn the fundamentals of finding and manipulating data for use in web mapping, designing a user experience around web maps, and using various javascript libraries and cloud services to build custom web-based map projects.</p>
      <p>This is not a “follow the tutorial” lab.  Instructors will present live demonstrations to introduce concepts, but students will execute on their own vision, ideas, and subject matter at every phase.  Each class will consist of 60-90 minutes of instruction/live demos, and the remainder of lab time is for students to begin implementing what they’ve learned to complete that week’s assignment, ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and/or build towards the final project.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><span class="kicker">Requirements and Prerequisite Skills</span>A basic understanding of modern website structure and design using HTML, CSS, and javascript is preferred, but not required.  Those who have never done web development and programming or need a refresher before should complete at least the first 2 projects in this <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">free online tutorial</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><span class="kicker">Equipment and Software</span>Students are expected to bring a laptop to class. Macs are preferred (both instructors will be demonstrating using Macs)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome (Latest) - We will use Chrome’s Developer Tools in class, and all assignments and projects will be expected to work in Chrome.</li>
        <li>Sublime Text 3 - Text Editor w/ jsLinter and zencoding plugin.</li>
        <li>Git - Version Control Software</li>

      <span class="kicker">Class Format</span>
      <p>Each class will consist of 60-90 minutes of instruction/live demonstration of concepts by the instructor.  The remainder of the time is hands-on, where students can begin implementing what they’ve learned to complete that week’s assignment, ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and/or build towards the final project.</p>
    </div> -->
    <div class="section">
      <p><span class="kicker">Assignments</span>Most classes will have an associated assignment that will require using the concepts/tools covered in that class session to build a web page with a map.  Assignments can be hosted anywhere, but github pages are recommended as a free option.  Students will submit only a URL to their assignment.</p>
      <p>Each assignment must incorporate a short write-up, somehow included into the web page.  This can be a pop-up info window, or a static element on the page, or some combination of elements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><span class="kicker">Final Project</span>Students will complete a final interactive web mapping project that builds on the tools and techniques covered throughout the class.  It should incorporate interactive web mapping, good design and UI practices, well-structured and clean code.  The subject matter is completely up to you, choose a topic that interests you and that you can build an engaging web mapping experience around.</p>
      <p>Final projects must be approved by the instructor(s) via a design sketch/mockup and a short paragraph about what the visualization will show/do, what data will be used, etc. Final Projects must be approved by the instructors before November 25th.</p>
      <p>Group projects are allowed, with teams of 3 people or less.</p>
